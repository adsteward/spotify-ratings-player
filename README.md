### Spotify Players w/ Ratings

~eventually~ this will be a toolbar app where users can play/pause/skip spotify and rate each song out of three stars.

The concept is that users will initially set up playlists for "1 star," "2 star," and "3 star" songs to which the corresponding songs will but put upon rating

There will also be functionality to add a song to any other of the user's playlists.

Yes, this is the result of a very specific request by someone who wants very specific and not widely applicable or desired functionality out of spotify.
